L4D2-Competitive-Framework
==========================

This repository contains the most up-to-date plugins(both binaries and sources), extensions, vscripts and shared settings files. All modern competitive L4D2 configs/mods rely on this framework.

Absolute compatibility and stability is guaranteed for Equilibrium sources. All of them were written by myself personally, and tested accordingly on Ubuntu 14.04.

Stability for Promod sources is not guaranteed due to reasons beyond my domain of influence. Most of them were not written by me and I bear no responsibility for them.
